# open_diet_2025
Simulating Classical and Quantum Walks with an Arduino-Based LED System, a project for the event [Open DIET 2025](https://diet.web.uniroma1.it/en/node/6883).

## Equipment
To carry out this project we need:
- [Arduino Uno R3](https://docs.arduino.cc/hardware/uno-rev3/);
- LED strip (WS2812B, e.g. the [BTF-LIGHTING DC5V WS2812B ECO RGB](https://www.amazon.it/BTF-LIGHTING-indirizzabili-individualmente-flessibile-controller/dp/B088W62171?th=1) i used, not included in the Arduino Uno R3 Kit);
- USB Cable (included in the Arduino Uno R3 Kit) to power the system;
- Breadboard (included in the Arduino Uno R3 Kit) to smoothly connect the Arduino UNO R3 to the LED strip;
- Resistor (included in the Arduino Uno R3 Kit), say of 10K$\Omega$;
- Button (included in the Arduino Uno R3 Kit);
- Jumper wires (included in the Arduino Uno R3 Kit).

## Connection scheme
We need to connect the Arduino to a laptop in order to execute custom programs and also to power te system, then connect Arduino to the LED strip via the Breadbord where the button is placed in order to turn on and of the LEDs.
